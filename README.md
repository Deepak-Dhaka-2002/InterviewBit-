How to contribute?

    Fork the repository
    Do the desired changes (add/delete/modify)
    Make a pull request

When to contribute?

    If there is no solution to a problem in the main branch.
    If your solution is asymptotically faster than the one in the main branch.
    If your algorithm is of the same time complexity but with reduced code size. In this case, comment out the original solution and make a pull request with your solution.
    If you have another method of solving the problem which is asymptotically slower than the original method then, comment your solution in the main file and make a pull request.

What I'll be doing with this repository

One day in the foreseeable future I will have solved all the challenges on interviewbit. Then this repository will mostly become a static one.

Constructive criticisms or code reviews of any kind are very much welcome.
